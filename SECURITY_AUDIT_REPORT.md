# Security Audit Report - BabySim Application

## Executive Summary

This security audit has identified and addressed critical security vulnerabilities in the BabySim application. All identified issues have been fixed with comprehensive input validation, XSS prevention, and data integrity measures.

## Vulnerabilities Identified & Fixed

### 1. Critical Input Validation Issues ⚠️ FIXED

**Issue**: Silent truncation of user input without feedback
- **Location**: `RequirementsInput.tsx` (lines 22-24)
- **Risk**: Medium - Users unaware of data loss
- **Fix**: Implemented `SecureTextInput` component with validation feedback

**Issue**: No XSS protection on user inputs
- **Location**: All input components
- **Risk**: High - Cross-site scripting attacks
- **Fix**: Comprehensive XSS sanitization in `ValidationService`

### 2. Save/Load Data Corruption ⚠️ FIXED

**Issue**: JSON parsing without validation
- **Location**: `saveGameService.ts` (lines 180, 215, 247)
- **Risk**: High - Malicious save data injection
- **Fix**: Added `validateSaveData()` method with security checks

**Issue**: Weak ID generation
- **Location**: `saveGameService.ts` (line 20)
- **Risk**: Medium - Predictable save IDs
- **Fix**: Cryptographically secure ID generation

### 3. File Upload Vulnerabilities ⚠️ FIXED

**Issue**: No file type validation
- **Location**: `SaveLoadMenu.tsx` (line 44-50)
- **Risk**: High - Malicious file uploads
- **Fix**: Strict file validation with type/size limits

**Issue**: Path traversal vulnerability
- **Location**: File import functionality
- **Risk**: High - Directory traversal attacks
- **Fix**: Filename sanitization and path validation

## Security Enhancements Implemented

### 1. ValidationService ✅

Created comprehensive validation service with:
- XSS pattern detection and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- Path traversal protection
- HTML entity encoding
- Input length and character validation
- Email validation with security checks

### 2. SecureTextInput Component ✅

Implemented secure input wrapper with:
- Real-time validation feedback
- XSS prevention
- Character count enforcement
- Visual validation indicators
- Automatic sanitization

### 3. Enhanced Save/Load Security ✅

Upgraded save game service with:
- Cryptographically secure ID generation
- Deep game state validation
- Malicious pattern detection
- Data integrity checks
- Version validation

### 4. File Upload Protection ✅

Added file upload security:
- MIME type validation
- File size limits (5MB)
- Filename sanitization
- Extension validation
- Content validation

## Security Test Suite ✅

Comprehensive test coverage including:
- XSS attack vectors (script, iframe, event handlers)
- Input validation edge cases
- Email validation security
- Save data integrity checks
- File upload security
- Game state validation
- Custom decision sanitization

## Code Changes Summary

### New Files Created:
1. `src/services/validationService.ts` - Core security validation
2. `src/components/SecureTextInput.tsx` - Secure input component
3. `tests/security/securityTests.test.ts` - Security test suite

### Modified Files:
1. `src/services/saveGameService.ts` - Enhanced with validation
2. `src/components/RequirementsInput.tsx` - Uses secure input
3. `src/components/SaveLoadMenu.tsx` - Added file validation
4. `src/components/InformationCenter.tsx` - Secure email input

## Security Recommendations

### Immediate (Implemented):
- ✅ Input sanitization for XSS prevention
- ✅ File upload validation
- ✅ Save data integrity checks
- ✅ Secure ID generation

### Future Considerations:
- Implement Content Security Policy headers
- Add rate limiting for save operations
- Consider implementing CSRF tokens
- Add input validation on server-side (when backend is added)
- Implement secure session management

## Testing Instructions

Run the security test suite:
```bash
npm test -- tests/security/securityTests.test.ts
```

### Manual Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Try entering script tags in text inputs
- [ ] Attempt to upload non-JSON files
- [ ] Test oversized file uploads
- [ ] Enter malicious email addresses
- [ ] Try XSS payloads in save names
- [ ] Import malicious save files

## Risk Assessment

| Risk Category | Before | After | Mitigation |
|---------------|---------|-------|------------|
| XSS Attacks | High | Low | Input sanitization |
| Data Corruption | High | Low | Validation service |
| File Upload | High | Low | Type/size validation |
| Injection | Medium | Low | Pattern detection |
| Path Traversal | High | Low | Filename sanitization |

## Compliance

The implemented security measures address:
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Input validation best practices
- XSS prevention guidelines
- File upload security standards
- Data integrity requirements

## Conclusion

All critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed with comprehensive validation, sanitization, and testing. The application now provides:

1. **Robust input validation** with real-time feedback
2. **XSS protection** across all user inputs
3. **Secure save/load operations** with data integrity
4. **Protected file uploads** with strict validation
5. **Comprehensive test coverage** for security scenarios

The BabySim application is now significantly more secure against common web vulnerabilities while maintaining excellent user experience through clear validation feedback.
