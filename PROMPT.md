# Next Claude Code Session Prompt

I'm continuing work on a BabySim parenting simulator project. Please read the SESSION_HANDOFF.md file in the project directory to understand what was completed in the previous session and what the next priorities are.

**Project location:** `/home/dfdan/projects/babysim-clone/`

**Previous session completed:** Multiple Children Support system with family management, sibling relationships, and resource allocation.

**Current status:** Production-ready family system fully integrated with backward compatibility.

**Top priority features to implement next:**
1. **Statistics & Analytics Dashboard** - Detailed outcome analysis across multiple children, family decision pattern insights, cross-child development comparisons
2. **Achievement & Badge System** - Family milestone achievements, individual child development badges, sibling relationship achievements

**Please review the SESSION_HANDOFF.md document and let me know what you think we should work on next, or suggest other improvements based on the current project state.**
